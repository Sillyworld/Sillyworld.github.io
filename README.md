# Sillyworld.github.io

This is my personal website. Currently it is built using bootstrap 4, ekko lightbox and font awesome icons.
This is a WIP, currently it is based on a template from bootsrap 4 of a course I took on Udemy, but it still has some bugs, next is change colors (probably using SASS, just for fun) and fix some responsive issues. 
Version 2.0 will be up later, once I have the time to sit down and do a proper desing of my page (still with bootstrap 4)
