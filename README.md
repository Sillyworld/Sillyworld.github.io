# Sillyworld.github.io

This is my personal website. Currently it is built using bootstrap 4, ekko lightbox and font awesome icons.
This is a WIP, currently it is based on a template from bootsrap 4 of a course I took on Udemy, but it still has some bugs, next is change colors (probably using SASS, just for fun) and fix some responsive issues.
